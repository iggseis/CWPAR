CWPAR
======
## What is CWPAR ?
This package is for the **Clipped Waveform Pick-up and Restoration** (**CWPAR**).

It will pick up the clipped seismic waveform and restore the waveform using POCS method.

For more detailed technical information, please refer to:

***Zhang, J. H.** et al., 2016, Restoration of clipped seismic waveforms using projection onto convex sets method, Scientific Reports,6:39056, doi: 10.1038/srep39056*

## Info

`CWPAR.m` is the main program, which calls the other Matlab functions.

This package uses the Matlab scripts developed by Frederik Simons (http://geoweb.princeton.edu/people/simons/software.html) to allow for reading and writing sac files in Matlab -- `readsac.m`, `suf.m`, `defval.m`, `osdep.m`, `nounder.m`

These scripts are dependent on `sac_sun2pc_mat.m` by C. D. Saragiotis and `cprintf.m` by Yair Altman (altmany at gmail dot com).
